\title{Determine the SDP matrix for uniform noise under multiple uncertainty}
\usage{
SDP_uniform(f, p, x_grid, h_grid, sigma_g, pdfn = function(P, s) dunif(P, 1 -
  s, 1 + s), sigma_m, sigma_i, f_int)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{the growth function of the escapement population (x-h)
should be a function of f(t, y, p), with parameters p}

\item{p}{the parameters of the growth function}

\item{x_grid}{the discrete values allowed for the population size, x}

\item{h_grid}{the discrete values of harvest levels to optimize over}

\item{sigma_g}{is the shape parameter (width) of the multiplicitive growth noise}

\item{pdfn}{is the shape of the growth noise, which need not be uniform (is by default)}

\item{sigma_m}{is the half-width of the uniform measurement error (assumes uniform distribution)}

\item{sigma_i}{is the half-width of the implementation noise (always assumes uniform distribution)}

\item{f_int}{is the function given by the analytic solution,}
}
\description{
Computes the transition matrix under the case of growth noise,
implementation errors in harvesting, and meaurement errors in
the stock assessment.  Assumes noise sources are distributed
by uniform distributions to obtain analytic transition probability densities.
