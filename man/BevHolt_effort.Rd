\title{Beverton Holt growth model with fishing-effort based control}
\usage{
BevHolt_effort(x, h, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{fish population}

\item{h}{fishing effort (harvest is effort times fish population)}

\item{p}{parameters of the growth function, c(A, B), where
A is the maximum growth rate and B the half-maximum in Beverton-Holt.}
}
\value{
population next year
}
\description{
Beverton Holt growth model with fishing-effort based control
}
\details{
Harvesting takes place before reproduction in ths model.
 The carrying capacity is K <- (pars[1]-1)/pars[2]
 Try with pars <- c(2,4)
}
