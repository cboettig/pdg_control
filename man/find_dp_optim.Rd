\usage{
find_dp_optim(SDP_Mat, x_grid, h_grid, OptTime, xT, profit, delta, reward = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{SDP_Mat}{the stochastic transition matrix at each h value}

\item{x_grid}{the discrete values allowed for the population size, x}

\item{h_grid}{the discrete values of harvest levels to optimize over}

\item{OptTime}{the stopping time}

\item{xT}{the boundary condition population size at OptTime}

\item{c}{the cost/profit function, a function of harvested level}

\item{delta}{the exponential discounting rate}

\item{reward}{the profit for finishing with >= Xt fish at the end
(i.e. enforces the boundary condition)}
}
\value{
list containing the matrices D and V.  D is an x_grid by OptTime
 matrix with the indices of h_grid giving the optimal h at each value x
 as the columns, with a column for each time.
 V is a matrix of x_grid by x_grid, which is used to store the value
 function at each point along the grid at each point in time.
 The returned V gives the value matrix at the first (last) time.
