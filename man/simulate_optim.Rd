\title{Forward simulate given the optimal havesting policy when cost depends on prev harvest}
\usage{
simulate_optim(f, pars, x_grid, h_grid, x0, D, z_g, z_m, z_i, alt_D = NULL,
  OptTime = dim(D[[1]])[2], profit, penalty, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{the growth function of the escapement population (x-h)
should be a function of f(y, p), with parameters p}

\item{x_grid}{the discrete values allowed for the population size, x}

\item{h_grid}{the discrete values of harvest levels to optimize over}

\item{D}{the optimal solution indices on h_grid,
given for each possible state at each timestep}

\item{z_g}{a function which returns a random multiple for population growth}

\item{z_m}{a function which returns the measurement uncertainty in the
assessment of stock size}

\item{z_i}{a function which returns a random number from a distribution
for the implementation uncertainty in quotas}

\item{alt_D}{an option to compute harvest with an alternate
"optimal" solution as well, for comparison (indep of h_prev)}

\item{p}{the parameters of the growth function}

\item{Xo}{initial stock size}
}
\value{
a data frame with the time, fishstock, harvested amount,
 and what the escapement ("unharvested") is. Also the alternate
 fishstock and harvest dynamics, if calculated
}
\description{
This simulates a process where there is a cost to changing the policy.
