Pretty Darn Good Control working examples directory
==================================================

This is an actively working research directory.  This readme is primarily for my own reference to keep track of the various examples.  This project is part of my Open Lab Notebook, see [this description](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/4325).  


* `profile_optimpolicy.md` -- an example of profiling the code to determine rate-limiting routines
* `model_uncertainty.md` An active adaptive management example
* `Reed.md` -- A simple example based on the Reed model.
* `stability_analysis.md` -- Example estimating stability coefficients, variance, etc in exploited and unexploited populations

policycosts
-----------

Examples showing the impact of adding costs to changing the policy (i.e. the TAC) based on the annual stock estimate.  

robustness
----------

Examples of applying the optimal policy under conditions differing slightly from the idealized model under which the optimal policy is computed.
